Within a given resource theory, you have objects and resources.

# Allowed Operations

Allowed operations are resource non-increasing by definition. Hence, if there exists an operation $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{F}$ such that $\mathcal{E}(\rho) = \sigma$ where $\rho, \sigma \notin \mathcal{O}$ then it must be the case that $\sigma$ has less than or equal to the resource content of $\rho$. 

The allowed operations define a [preorder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preorder) on the space of states [ðŸ’­](#myDefinitionofPreOrder). If an allowed operation exists mapping a state $\rho$ to $\sigma$ then  
\begin{equation}
    \rho \prec \sigma. 
\end{equation}
