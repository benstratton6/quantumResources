(classical_information_quantum_info_glossary)=
**Classical Information:** Information encoded in a physical system who's evolution is described via the laws of classical physics.

(LOCC_quantum_info_glossary)=
**LOCC:** This set of operations are often taken to be the allowed operations of the resource theory of entanglement. 

(prime_dimensions_quantum_info_glossary)=
**Prime Dimensions:** This appear to be the case as $N=2$ systems have to be treated differently, and hence all factors of 2 in a $d$-dimensional (not prime $d$) systems would also need to be treated differently. 

(multiplicity_quantum_info_glossary)=
**multiplicity:** the number of different eigenvectors that a given degenerate eigenvalue corresponds to. 

(orthogonal_complement_quantum_info_glossary)=
**Orthogonal Complement:** The orthogonal complement of a vector space $V$ is the set of vectors orthogonal to all vectors in $V$.
