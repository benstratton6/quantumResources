## Definition 

A quantum channel is a completely positive, trace-preserving map (from the set of density operators to itself). 

A channel mapping from states in an input Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{in}$ to an output Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_{out}$ is denoted as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}: \mathcal{H}_{in} \rightarrow \mathcal{H}_{out}
\end{equation}
