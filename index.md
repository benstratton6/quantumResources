## Quantum Resources

This webpage is a collection of small notes on topics I have had throughout my PhD. I have written things in the way I understood them. I thought I would share them in the hope that someone else find them useful.

## About Me

My name is Ben Stratton and I am a third year PhD student at the University of Bristol studying problems in quantum information theory. My current interests are in and around the fields of quantum resource theories, quantum thermodynamics, quantum computation and general quantum technologies.

Originally from Devon, England, I studied for my MSci in physics at the University of Bristol between 2016-2020, taking units in Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Computation, Advance Quantum Mechanics and Advance Computational Physics. I returned to Bristol in 2021 to join the Quantum Engineering Centre for Doctoral Training. During the first year of my PhD I undertook an interdisciplinary range of teaching that included courses in Quantum Light and Matter, Applied Quantum Theory, Nanofabrication and Quantum Systems Engineering. I then joined the Quantum Information Theory group under the supervision of Paul Skrzypczyk to work on problems in quantum information theory.

Other notational highlights alongside my academic pursuits have been teaching a class as part of the Foundations of Physics course for foundation year students, demonstrated in the second year lab, co-organising Careers in Quantum â€“ a student led quantum careers fair, and conducting outreach at the Blue Dot Science Festival.

**Abstract:** Information is instrumental in our understanding of thermodynamics. Their interplay has been studied through completely degenerate Hamiltonians whereby the informational contributions to thermodynamic transformations can be isolated. In this setting, all states other than the maximally mixed state are considered to be in informational nonequilibrium. An important yet still open question is how to characterize the ability of quantum dynamics to preserve informational nonequilibrium. Here, the dynamical resource theory of informational nonequilibrium preservability is introduced to begin providing an answer to this question. A characterization of the allowed operations is given for qubit channels and the n-dimensional Weyl-covariant channelsâ€”a physically relevant subset of the general channels. An operational interpretation of a state discrimination game with Bell state measurements is given. Finally, an explicit link between a channelâ€™s classical capacity and its ability to preserve informational nonequilibrium is made.
