**linearly dependent:** The set of vectors $\{ a_{1}, ~a_{2}, \ldots, ~a_{n} \} $ are linearly dependent if there exists $\lambda_1,~\lambda_2, \ldots ~\lambda_n~\in~\mathbb{F}^{1}$, where $\lambda_{j}$ is not equal to $0$ for all $n$, such that $\lambda_1 a_{1} + \lambda_2 a_2 \ldots \lambda_n a_n = 0$
