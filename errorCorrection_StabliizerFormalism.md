The stabilizer formalism is a method for creating error correcting codes using the Pauli-group. In addition to allowing certain errors to be detected and correct, logical gates can also be performed in this framework. 

## Pauli-group 

The generators of the qubit Pauli-group are
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_1 = \langle X, Z, i\mathbb{I} \rangle.
\end{equation}
From these operators all elements of the one qubit Pauli-group can be generated. The Pauli-group is the set of Pauli-operators plus identity with all possible phases of $\{\pm 1, \pm i \}$. 

The $n$-qubit Pauli-group , $\mathcal{P}_n$, is then the $n$-fold tensor product of elements in the one qubit Pauli-group. All elements in $\mathcal{P}_n$ either commute or anit-commute,
\begin{equation}
P_1P_2 = (\pm)P_2P_1 ~~ \forall ~ ~ P_1, P_2~\in~\mathcal{P}_n,
\end{equation} 

## Stabilizer Codes

The stabilizers of an error correcting code are defined as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{S} = \big\{ P_i \in \mathcal{P}_n: P_i \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L~\forall~\ket{\psi}_L \wedge [P_i, P_j] = 0 ~ \forall ~ (i,j) \big\},
\end{equation}
such that $-\mathbb{I} \notin \mathcal{S}$. The stabilizers are therefore an [Abelian subgroup](#Abelian_group_target_glossary) of the $n$-qubit Pauli-group, $\mathcal{P}_n$, such that all logical states (states in the code space) are $(+1)$ eigenstates of each stabilizer, that does not contain the negative identity operator. 

The justification of these conditions are as follows:

1. $P_i \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L~\forall~\ket{\psi}_L$:
    
    This avoids any logical information encoded in the code space being destroyed when a stablizer is measured on $\ket{\psi}_L$.

    :::{dropdown} Further Details

    A state, $\ket{\omega}$ is said to be stabilized by an operator $U$ if $U\ket{\omega} = \ket{\omega}$, meaning $\ket{\omega}$ is a $(+1)$ eigenstate of $U$. 
    
    From the above definition of $\mathcal{S}$, it can be seen that $\forall~P_i \in \mathcal{S}$ all logical states $\ket{\psi}_L$ are stabilized by $P_i$. Therefore, if one were to measure or apply $P_i$ on any logical state $\ket{\psi}_L$ they would return the state $\ket{\psi}_L$ unchanged. This avoids any logical information encoded in the code space being destroyed when a stablizer is measured on $\ket{\psi}_L$. (Does it also prevent loss of logical information in general? I am currently not sure). 
    
    One can reverse this definition, and defined the code space to be the subspace of the total Hilbert space that is stabilized by all elements of $\mathcal{S}$. Phrased alternatively, the code space is defined as the intersection of all $(+1)$ eigenspaces of the elements of $\mathcal{S}$.  
    :::

2. $[P_i, P_j] = 0$:

    If this condition is not met, only the trivial space can be stabilized. 

    :::{dropdown} Proof
 
    Let $P_i, P_j \in \mathcal{P}_n$ such that $[P_i, P_j] \neq 0$. Moreover, assume they both stabilize $\ket{\psi}_L$ such that 
    \begin{equation}
    P_i \ket{\psi}_L = P_j \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L.
    \end{equation}

    Firstly, note that given that all elements of $\mathcal{P}_n$ commute or anti-commute,
    \begin{equation}
    [P_i, P_j] \neq 0  \implies P_iP_j + P_jP_i = 0.
    \end{equation}
    Secondly, the products, $P_iP_j$ and $P_jP_i$ also stabilize $\ket{\psi}_L$ if $P_i$ and $P_j$ individually stabilize $\ket{\psi}_L$, such that 
    \begin{align*}
    P_iP_j \ket{\psi}_L &= \ket{\psi}_L, \\
    P_jP_i \ket{\psi}_L &= \ket{\psi}_L.
    \end{align*}

    Putting these facts together implies that 
    \begin{align*}
    P_jP_i \ket{\psi}_L &= - P_iP_j \ket{\psi}_L, \\
    &=  - \ket{\psi}_L, \\
    &= \ket{\psi}_L. 
    \end{align*}
    This is only true if $\ket{\psi}_L = 0$, meaning that non-[Abelian subgroups](#Abelian_group_target_glossary) of $\mathcal{P}_n$ can only stabilize a trivial subspace. 

    (Note, the equation $\ket{\psi}=-\ket{\psi}$ is about the physical equivalence of vectors in a Hilbert space, with this equation only being satasfied for the zero vector. It is not about whether two states are physically distinguishable under global phases.)

    :::

3. $- \mathbb{I} \notin \mathcal{S}$: 

    If this condition is not met, only the trivial space can be stabilized.  

    :::{dropdown} Proof
 
    All states are stabilized by $\mathbb{I}$, 
    \begin{equation}
      (\mathbb{I} ) \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L.
    \end{equation}
    Hence, $\mathbb{I} \in \mathcal{S}$ for all possible $\mathcal{S}$. 
    
    If one assumes that $-\mathbb{I} \in \mathcal{S}$, then one needs 
    \begin{equation}
    \big( - \mathbb{I} \big) \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L,
    \end{equation}
    by definition of $\mathcal{S}$. Combining these two facts implys that 
    \begin{equation}
    \ket{\psi}_L = - \ket{\psi}_L, 
    \end{equation}
    which is only true if $\ket{\psi}_L = 0$, meaning that $\mathcal{S}$ would only stabilize a trivial subspace.

## Measuring Stabilizer 

All elements of $\mathcal{P}_n$ are [unitary](#target_unitary_adjoint_page_unitary_definition). If $P \in \mathcal{P}_n$ is also [Hermitian](#hermitian_adjoint_page_target), then any stabilizer $P$ can be measured on the logic state indirectly, with the measurement outcome stored in an ancilla [ðŸ’­](#anti_hermitain_pauli_stab_measures_target_glossary).

A schematic of the circuit used to measure the stabilizer $P$ on the logical state $\ket{\psi}_L$. 
```

Assume that $P \in \mathcal{P}_n$ is a stabilizer of the logical state $\ket{\psi}_L$ such that $P \ket{\psi}_L = \ket{\psi}_L$. Let $E$ be some correctable error that has occurred on the logical state, such that $P ( E \ket{\psi}_L) = E \ket{\psi}_L$ or $P ( E \ket{\psi}_L) = - E \ket{\psi}_L$, depending on whether $E \ket{\psi}_L$ is in the positive or negative eigenspace of $P$. 

The input state into the circuit is $E\ket{\psi}_L \ket{0}_A$, where $A$ labels the ancillary space and the $L$ subscript now doubles as a label for the space of the logical state.  

The output state is then 
\begin{equation}
\frac{1}{2} \big( \mathbb{I}_L \otimes \mathbb{I}_A + P_L \otimes \mathbb{I}_A) E \ket{\psi}_L \ket{0}_A + \frac{1}{2} \big( \mathbb{I}_L \otimes \mathbb{I}_A - P_L \otimes \mathbb{I}_A) E \ket{\psi}_L \ket{1}_A.
\end{equation}

:::{dropdown} Proof

The input state to the circuit is 
\begin{equation}
E\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{0}_A.
\end{equation}
The controlled stabilizer gate can be written as 
\begin{equation}
P_LC_A = \mathbb{I}_L \otimes \ket{0}\bra{0}_A + P_L \otimes \ket{1}\bra{1}_A.
\end{equation}
The output state of the circuit is then 
\begin{align*}

&(\mathbb{I} \otimes H) P_L C_A (\mathbb{I} \otimes H) \big(E\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{0}_A \big) \\
=& (\mathbb{I} \otimes H)\big(\mathbb{I}_L \otimes \ket{0}\bra{0}_A + P_L \otimes \ket{1}\bra{1}_A \big)\big(E \ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{+} \big) \\
=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\mathbb{I} \otimes H) \big( E\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{0} + PE\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{1}   \big) \\
=& \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big( E\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{+} + PE\ket{\psi}_L \otimes \ket{-}   \big).\\
\end{align*}
Expanding $\ket{+}$ and $\ket{-}$ in the computational basis and factorising completes the proof. 
:::

Therefore, if $P ( E \ket{\psi}_L) = E \ket{\psi}_L$, the second term will go to zero and the output state becomes 
\begin{equation}
E \ket{\psi}_L \ket{0}_A,
\end{equation}
such that if one measures $Z$ on the ancilla they will get the outcome $+1$ (syndrome bit $0$) with certainty. 

If $P ( E \ket{\psi}_L) = - E \ket{\psi}_L$, the first term will go to zero and the output state becomes 
\begin{equation}
E \ket{\psi}_L \ket{1}_A,
\end{equation}
such that a $Z$ measurement performed on the ancilla now gives the outcome $-1$ (syndrome bit $1$) with certainty. 

By performing the above circuit and measuring the ancilla one can therefore determine if the logical state is in the $+1$ or $-1$ eigenspace of the stabilizer $P$. 

Note, this method of performing measurements only really works for measuring observables in $\mathcal{P}_n$ on stabilizer states.

:::{dropdown} Parity Measurements Circuits

When discussing the [2-bit repetition code](#target_error_correction_2_bit_repetition_code) it was noted that the measurement of the stabilizer was akin to performing a parity check on the qubits. Specifically, a logical qubit was encoded into space ${\rm Span}\{ \ket{00}, \ket{11}\}$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi}_L = \alpha \ket{00} + \beta \ket{11}, ~ ~ \vert \alpha \vert^2 + \vert \beta \vert^2=1.
\end{equation}
It was then seen that it was possible to perform error detection on the set of errors $\{\mathbb{I}, X_1, X_2 \}$ by measuring the stabilizer $Z_1 \otimes Z_2$. If $\mathbb{I}$ occurs, the state stays in the code space and measuring the stabilizer gives the output $+1$ (syndrome bit $0$). If either an $X_1$ or $X_2$ occurs, the state is mapped into the space ${\rm Span}\{ \ket{01}, \ket{10} \}$, and a measurement of the stabilizer gives the output $-1$ (syndrome bit $1$).

A simpler circuit can be used for measuring stabilizers that perform a parity check. The circuit for performing the parity check in the 2-bit repetition code is shown in the below figure. 

```{figure} errorCorrectionStabMeasureCircuitParity.png

:target: stab_measure_circuit_target

A circuit that checks the parity of two qubits and stores the result in an ancilla. $L_1$ and $L_2$ are used to label the two physical qubits used to create the single logical qubit. 
```

Firstly, the parity of two bits, $i_1, i_2 \in \{0,1\}$, is given by $i_1 \oplus i_2$. This will be zero if both bits are zero or both bits are one. If the bits differ, it will be one. 

Now, note that the action of a CNOT gate on some arbitrary computational basis state can be written as 
\begin{equation}
C_1X_2 \ket{i_1i_2} = \ket{i_1(i_2 \oplus i_1)}, ~ ~ i_1, i_2~\in~\{0,1\}.
\end{equation}
This works because a CNOT gate applies an $X$ gate to the second qubit if the first qubit is $i_1 = 1$. This $X$ gate will flip the second qubit, which can be done by adding $1$ to it. Hence, if $i_1 = 0$ nothing is added to the second qubit and it remains $i_2$. If $i_1=1$ then $1$ is added to $i_2$, flipping it. 

From here, consider that if it is not known if an error has occurred on an arbitrary qubit encoded into the code space, ${\rm Span}\{\ket{00}, \ket{11}\}$, the state can be written as
\begin{equation}
\alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)}.
\end{equation}
The input into the circuit is then 
\begin{align*}
\big( \alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \big) \otimes \ket{0}_A.
\end{align*}
The action of the first CNOT gate is then 
\begin{align*}
&C_2X_A \big( \alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{0}_A + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{0}_A \big) \\
=&\alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{0 \oplus i_2}_A + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{(i_2 \oplus 1)}_A \\
=& \alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{i_2} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{(i_2 \oplus 1)}_A,
\end{align*}
as $0 \oplus i_2 = i_2$. The action of the second CNOT gate is then 
\begin{align*}
&C_1X_A \big( \alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{i_2} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{(i_2 \oplus 1)}_A \big) \\
=&\alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{i_2 \oplus i_1} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{(i_2 \oplus 1) \oplus (i_1 \oplus 1)}_A \\
=& \alpha \ket{i_1 i_2} \otimes \ket{i_2 \oplus i_1} + \beta \ket{(i_1 \oplus 1)(i_2 \oplus 1)} \otimes \ket{i_2 \oplus i_1}_A,
\end{align*}
as $1 \oplus 1 = 0$. Hence, if $Z$ is measured on the computational basis then the parity is output with certainty.
