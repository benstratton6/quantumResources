(parity_check_operator_target_glossary)=
**Parity Check**: It can be seen in the second line that one can think of $Z_1 \otimes Z_2$ as measuring the parity of the two physical qubits. If the parity is $0$ then the measurement outcome is $(+1)$; if the parity is $1$ then the measurement outcome is $(-1)$.  

(Code_distance_target_glossary)=
**Code Distance**: This distance of a code is the minimum numbers of errors that will change one codeword to another. Alternatively, the distance of a code is the minimum number of errors that will go undetected. 

(Abelian_group_target_glossary)=
**Abelian Group**: A group in which the result of applying the group operation to two group elements does not depend on the order in which they are written i.e $g_1 \cdot g_2 = g_2 \cdot g_1$.
