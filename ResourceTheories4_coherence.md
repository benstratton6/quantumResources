## Coherence Overview

Mathematically, for a state $ \rho $ to have coherence with respect to a basis, the density matrix of $ \rho $ written with respect to that basis must have off diagonal terms. This means that with respect to this basis, there exists superpositions between the different basis states. 

:::{dropdown} Details

Consider the states $\ket{\psi_1}, \ket{\psi_2} \in \mathcal{H}^2$ that can be written with respect to the computational basis as 
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_1} = \ket{0}, ~ ~ \ket{\psi_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{0} + \ket{1} \big),
\end{equation}
such that $\ket{\psi_2}$ is in a superposition of the computational basis states. 

Now, consider the density matrices of these two states with respect to the computational basis,
\begin{align*}
\rho_1 &= \ket{\psi_1}\bra{\psi_1}, \\
&= \ket{0}\bra{0}, \\
&= \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 0 \\
0 & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\end{align*}
and 
\begin{align*}
\rho_2 &= \ket{\psi_2}\bra{\psi_2}, \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \big( \ket{0}\bra{0} + \ket{0}\bra{1}+ \ket{1}\bra{0}+ \ket{1}\bra{1} \big), \\
&= \frac{1}{2} \begin{pmatrix}
1 & 1 \\
1 & 1
\end{pmatrix}.
\end{align*}
Therefore, being a superposition of states with respect to a basis means having coherence with respect to that basis. 

Whilst already implied above it is worth explicitly noting that coherence is basis dependent. Given $\ket{\psi_2} = \ket{+}$, it can be seen that $\ket{\psi_2}$ has no coherence with respect to the basis defined by the eigenvector of Pauli $X$ but does have coherence with respect to the computational basis (basis defined by Pauli $Z$).

## Speakable vs Unspeakable Coherence

If only the *amount* of coherence one has is the useful quantity (the resource) then the coherence is speakable. If the basis and the sub-spaces in which the coherence exists is important then the coherence is unspeakable. 

Consider the following two states,
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{0} + \ket{1} \big), ~ ~ ~ \ket{\psi_2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \big( \ket{0} + \ket{2} \big).
\end{equation}

If the label inside the ket is irrelevant to the task, such as in quantum computation, then the two states would be equally resourceful. If, instead, the labels do matter, such as in quantum phase estimation, then the coherence is speakable, and these two states are not equally resourceful.  

## Resource Theory of Unspeakable Coherence

### Framework

This resource theory is defined with respect to translationally-covariant operations. 

Firstly, consider an observable $L$ and the [continuous transformations](#continuous_transformations_target) defined by the family of unitary operators 
\begin{equation}
U_{L}(x) = e^{-ixL} : ~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1.
\end{equation}

A state $\rho \in \mathcal{H}$, has coherence with respect to the eigenspaces of $L$ if and only if it is [asymmetric](#symmetric_operator_definition_target_symmetryPage) with respect to the continuous transformations generated by $L$, 
\begin{equation}
U_{L}(x) \rho U_{L}(x)^{\dagger} \neq \rho ~ \forall ~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1.
\end{equation}
On the contrary, a state therefore has no coherence with respect to the eigenspaces of $L$ if and only if it is symmetric with respect to the continuous transformations generated by $L$, 
\begin{equation}
U_{L}(x) \rho U_{L}(x)^{\dagger} = \rho ~ \forall ~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1.
\end{equation}
The state $ \rho $ must be block diagonal with respect to the eigenspaces of $ L $ for it to be symmetric under $ U_{L}(x) $, which is the definition of having no coherence with respect to the eigenspaces of $L$. 

### Free States 

The set of free states, $\mathfrak{F}$, are those states which contain no resource - hence, in this case, they are termed the incoherent states. The set of free states is therefore
\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{F} = \{ \rho : U_{L}(x) \rho U_{L}(x)^{\dagger} = \rho ~ \forall ~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1 \},
\end{equation}
which are the states that have no coherence with respect to the eigenspaces of $L$. 

It can be seen that 
\begin{equation}
\rho \in \mathfrak{F} \Longleftrightarrow [L, \rho] = 0,
\end{equation}
meaning the set of free states are those that commute with the generator of the continuous transformations.

### Allowed Operations

The allowed operations of the resource theory are those that are translationally-covariant. A quantum operations $\mathcal{E}$ is translationally-covariant with respect to the transformation $U_{L}(x)$ if 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}_{L}(x) \circ \mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E} \circ \mathcal{U}_{L}(x),
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{U}_{L}(x)(\cdot) = U_{L}(x)(\cdot)U_{L}(x)^\dagger$. This means that one can apply the operation before or after a transformation $U_{L}(x)$ and get the same outcome. 

The broadest definition of allowed operations is that they are the set of operations that maps the free states to the free states. This can be seen to be true for translationally-covariant operations by considering $\rho \in \mathfrak{F}$ and letting $\mathcal{E}$ be a translationally-covariant operation, then 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}_{L}(x) \circ \mathcal{E}(\rho) = \mathcal{E} \circ \big(\mathcal{U}_{L}(x)\big)(\rho) = \mathcal{E}(\rho)~\forall~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1,
\end{equation}
as $\big(\mathcal{U}_{L}(x)\big)(\rho) = \rho ~\forall~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1$. Therefore, $\mathcal{E}(\rho) \in \mathfrak{F}$ as it is asymmetric under $U_{L}(x)$. Hence, translationally-covariant operations map free states to free states. 

Finally, the allowed operations can then be defined as
\begin{equation}
\mathfrak{O} = \{ \mathcal{E}:  \mathcal{U}_{L}(x) \circ \mathcal{E} = \mathcal{E} \circ \mathcal{U}_{L}(x)~\forall~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1 \}.
\end{equation}

**Free Dilations:**

All allowed operations, $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{O}$, have a free dilation, meaning they can be written as 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(\rho) = \textrm{tr} \big[ V_{AB} \big(\rho_A \otimes \sigma_B) V^\dagger_{AB} \big]
\end{equation}
where $\sigma \in \mathfrak{F}$ and $V_{AB}$ is a translationally-covariant isometry. 

**Measurements:**

Consider an operation $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{O}$ that maps from a non-trivial input space to a trivial output space i.e, a measurement defined by an effect $E$ such that 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{E}(\cdot) = \textrm{tr}\big[E(\cdot)\big], ~ ~ 0 \leq E \leq \mathbb{I}.
\end{equation} 
In this case, one gets the a similar conditions as for states with
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{U}^{\dagger}_{L}(x)\big(E \big) = E ~ \forall~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1 ~~ {\rm if} ~ ~ \mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{O}.
\end{equation}
As before, this condition is true if and only if $[L,E]=0$. 

A POVM - a collection of effects that sums to the identity - is said to be a translationally-covariant POVM if and only if each of its effects commutes with $L$. 

**Unitaries:**

If $\mathcal{E} \in \mathfrak{O}$ is a unitary operation, $\mathcal{E}(\cdot) = V(\cdot)V^\dagger$, then 
\begin{equation}
[U_{L}(x), V] = 0 ~\forall~x~\in~\mathbb{R}^1.
\end{equation}
which is equivalent to $[L, V] = 0$, meaning $V$ is block diagonal with respect to the eigenspaces of $L$. 

### Resource Measures

The spectral decompostion of $L$ is 
\begin{equation}
L = \sum_k \lambda_k \Pi_k,
\end{equation}
where $ \Pi_k$ is the projector onto the eigenspace of $L$ associated to the eigenvalue $ \lambda_k $.

The dephasing channel with respect to the operator $L$ is then 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{D}(\rho) = \sum_k \Pi_k (\rho) \Pi_k.
\end{equation}

The following functions are [resource measures](#quantifying_resource_page_target) of unspeakable coherence. This means they are at least faithful and monotonic under allowed operations. 

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Relative Entropy
:sync: tab1

let $\rho \in \mathcal{H}$. 

The relative entropy of asymmetry is defined as 
\begin{equation}
A(\rho) \coloneqq S(\rho \vert \vert \mathcal{D}(\rho)) = S(\mathcal{D}(\rho)) - S(\rho),
\end{equation}

where $S(\cdot \vert \vert \cdot)$ is the [quantum relative entropy](#quantum_relative_entropy) and $S(\cdot)$ is the [Von Neumann Entropy](#Von_Neumann_Entropy_Equation_target).

:::
:::{tab-item} Trace Norm
:sync: tab2

let $\rho \in \mathcal{H}$. 

The *distance* to the dephased state is a measure of coherence and is given by 
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{R}(\rho) \coloneqq \vert \vert \rho - \mathcal{D}(\rho) \vert \vert_1,
\end{equation}
where $\vert \vert \cdot \vert \vert_1$ is the [trace norm](#schatten_norms_target_norms_page). 

:::
:::{tab-item} Trace Norm 2
:sync: tab3

let $\rho \in \mathcal{H}$. 

The coherence can be quantified by the operator that is output from the commutator of the state $ \rho $ and $L$,  
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{F}(\rho) \coloneqq \vert \vert ~ [\rho, L] ~ \vert \vert_1,
\end{equation}
where $\vert \vert \cdot \vert \vert_1$ is the [trace norm](#schatten_norms_target_norms_page). 

Note that if $[\rho, L]=0$ then the state has no coherence.
