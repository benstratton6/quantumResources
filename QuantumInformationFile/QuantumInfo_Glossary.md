(classical_information_quantum_info_glossary)=
**Classical Information:** Information encoded in a physical system who's evolution is described via the laws of classical physics.

(LOCC_quantum_info_glossary)=
**LOCC:** This set of operations are often taken to be the allowed operations of the resource theory of entanglement. 

(prime_dimensions_quantum_info_glossary)=
**Prime Dimensions:** This appear to be the case as $N=2$ systems have to be treated differently, and hence all factors of 2 in a $d$-dimensional (not prime $d$) systems would also need to be treated differently.
