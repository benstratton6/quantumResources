## Setup 

Let there be two spatially separated parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), who share a $d=2$ dimension maximally entangled bipartite state,
\begin{equation}
\ket{\Phi^{+}_{00}}_{AB} = \frac{\ket{0}_{A}\ket{0}_{B}+\ket{1}_{A} \ket{1}_{B}}{\sqrt{2}}~\in~\mathcal{H}_{A} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{B}.
\end{equation}

It is assumed they have the ability to perform any operation on a quantum system in their respective labs and that they can send any amount of classical information to each other [ðŸ’­](#classical_information_quantum_info_glossary). These operations are known the set of *local operations and classical communication* ([LOCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOCC)) [ðŸ’­](#LOCC_quantum_info_glossary).

Alice has a single copy of the qubit,
\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi}_{A_1} = \alpha \ket{0}_{A_1} + \beta \ket{1}_{A_1}~\in~\mathcal{H}_{A_{1}},
\end{equation}
in her laboratory that she wants to send to Bob. The subscript $A_1$ shows that the state is in Alice's lab. Given Alice and Bob can only send classical information to each other, Alice cannot send the qubit to Bob directly. 


## Teleportation Protocol

Alice can instead send the qubit $\ket{\psi}_{A_1}$ to Bob via the [quantum teleportation protocol](10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.1895).  

The quantum teleportation protocol states that it is possible for Alice to exactly send the state $\ket{\psi}_{A_1}$ to Bob using: a maximally entangled state, $\ket{\Phi_{00}^{+}}_{AB}$, a measurement in the maximally entangled basis, two classical bits and one local unitary.  

*The Protocol*: 

The initial state shared between Alice and Bob is
\begin{align*}
\ket{\Psi}_{A_{1}AB} &= \ket{\psi}_{A_1} \otimes \ket{\Phi^{+}_{00}}_{AB}~\in~\mathcal{H}_{A_1} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{A} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{B} \\
&= \big[ \alpha \ket{0}_{A_1} + \beta \ket{1}_{A_1} \big] \otimes \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\big[ \ket{0}_{A}\ket{0}_{B_1}+\ket{1}_{A} \ket{1}_{B} \big].
\end{align*} 

This state, $\ket{\Psi}_{A_{1}AB}$, can then be expanded and rewritten as 
\begin{align*}
\ket{\Psi}_{A_{1}AB} = \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \big[ \ket{0}_{A_1}\ket{0}_{A} + \ket{1}_{A_1}\ket{1}_{A} \big] \big[ \alpha \ket{0}_{B} + \beta \ket{1}_B \big] \\
+  \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \big[ \ket{0}_{A_1}\ket{0}_{A} - \ket{1}_{A_1}\ket{1}_{A} \big] \big[ \alpha \ket{0}_{B} - \beta \ket{1}_B \big] \\
+ \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \big[ \ket{0}_{A_1}\ket{1}_{A} + \ket{1}_{A_1}\ket{0}_{A} \big] \big[ \beta \ket{0}_{B} + \alpha \ket{1}_B \big] \\
+ \frac{1}{2 \sqrt{2}} \big[ \ket{0}_{A_1}\ket{1}_{A} - \ket{1}_{A_1}\ket{0}_{A} \big] \big[ - \beta \ket{0}_{B} + \alpha \ket{1}_B \big] .
\end{align*}

Alice now measures the operator which has the [Bell states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_state) as its eigenvectors,
\begin{equation}
O = \lambda_{00} \ket{\Phi^{+}_{00}}\bra{\Phi^{+}_{00}} + \lambda_{01} \ket{\Phi^{+}_{01}}\bra{\Phi^{+}_{01}} + \lambda_{10} \ket{\Phi^{+}_{10}}\bra{\Phi^{+}_{10}} + \lambda_{11} \ket{\Phi^{+}_{11}}\bra{\Phi^{+}_{11}},
\end{equation}
where
\begin{align*}

\ket{\Phi_{00}^{+}} &= \frac{\ket{0}_{A}\ket{0}_{B}+\ket{1}_{A} \ket{1}_{B}}{\sqrt{2}}, \\
\ket{\Phi_{01}^{+}} &= \frac{\ket{0}_{A}\ket{0}_{B}-\ket{1}_{A} \ket{1}_{B}}{\sqrt{2}}, \\
\ket{\Phi_{10}^{+}} &= \frac{\ket{0}_{A}\ket{1}_{B}+\ket{1}_{A} \ket{0}_{B}}{\sqrt{2}}, \\
\ket{\Phi_{11}^{+}} &= \frac{\ket{0}_{A}\ket{1}_{B}-\ket{1}_{A} \ket{0}_{B}}{\sqrt{2}}. \\

\end{align*}

The state of Bob's system is dependent on the measurement outcome Alice gets from measuring $O$, 

\begin{align*}

\lambda_{00} &\rightarrow \alpha \ket{0} + \beta \ket{1}~\in ~ \mathcal{H}_{B} \\
\lambda_{01} &\rightarrow \alpha \ket{0} - \beta \ket{1}~\in ~ \mathcal{H}_{B} \\
\lambda_{10} &\rightarrow \beta \ket{0} + \alpha \ket{1}~\in ~ \mathcal{H}_{B} \\
\lambda_{11} &\rightarrow - \beta \ket{0} + \alpha \ket{1}~\in ~ \mathcal{H}_{B} \\

\end{align*}

Bob, however, does not know which of the above states he has. Alice therefore communicates to Bob her measurement outcome using two bits 
\begin{align*}
\lambda_{00} &\rightarrow \textrm{Alice sends}~ 00 \\
\lambda_{01} &\rightarrow \textrm{Alice sends}~ 01 \\
\lambda_{10} &\rightarrow \textrm{Alice sends}~ 10 \\
\lambda_{11} &\rightarrow \textrm{Alice sends}~ 11 \\
\end{align*}

Depending on the two bits Bob receives he then applies a unitary 
\begin{align*}
00 &\rightarrow \textrm{Bob applies}~ \mathbb{I}, \\
01 &\rightarrow \textrm{Bob applies}~ Z, \\
10 &\rightarrow \textrm{Bob applies}~ X, \\
11 &\rightarrow \textrm{Bob applies}~ Y. \\

\end{align*}

After this, Bob is left with the state $\ket{\psi}$ is his space. 

Hence, using one maximally entnagled state, one measurement in the Bell basis, two classical bits and one local rotation the state $\ket{\psi}$ has gone from Alice to Bob. Whilst the physical state has not been sent, the information that defines the state has been. 

## Higher Dimensional Systems


## Resource Theory Approach


:::{dropdown} What if Alice has multiple copies of the qubit?
:closed:

If Alice had many copies of $\ket{\psi}_{A}$ she could measure the operator 
\begin{equation}
Z= \ket{0} \bra{0} - \ket{1} \bra{1},
\end{equation} 
and record the measurement outcomes. Over many measurements she will discover what $ \alpha $ and $ \beta $ are. Alice can then encode these values in classical information and send them to Bob along with a specification of the basis she measured in. 

Bob can then prepare the state $\ket{0}$ and apply the unitary 
\begin{equation}
U =\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha & - \beta^{*} \\
\beta & \alpha^{*} \\
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
to get the state $\ket{\psi}_{A}$. Note, this can be performed up to the precision with which Alice can encode $\alpha$ and $\beta$. 

As well as being much more resource intensive (many copies of $\ket{\psi}_{A}$ are needed), this method also mean both Alice and Bob to know what the qubit is.
