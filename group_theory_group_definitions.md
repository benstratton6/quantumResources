There is much literature on groups, these particular notes were made using [](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2605.29137) and only pertain to discrete groups.

## Group Definition

Consider a set $G$ and a [binary operation](#binary_operation_glossary) $* :  G \times G \rightarrow G$. Then $(G, *)$ is a group if the following conditions hold: 
(group_page_group_definition)=
1. $(a * b) * c = a * (b * c), ~ ~ a,b,c \in G$
    - Associativity 
2. $ \exists ~ e \in G$ such that $e * g = g * e~\forall~g \in G$
    - Unique identity element
3. $ \forall a \in G, ~ ~\exists~b \in G$ such that $a * b = b * a = e$.
    - Unique inverse element denoted as $a^{-1}$ for $a \in G$. 

## Abelian Groups

Let $(G, *)$ be a group. For $a,b \in G$, it is said that $a$ and $b$ commute if $a * b = b*a$. 

A group is said to be abelian if all elements of $G$ mutually commute. If not, it is said to be non-abelian. 

## Subgroups 
(group_page_subgroup_definition)=
Let $(G, *)$ be a group. Given a subset $H \subseteq G$, then $(H, *)$ is a subgroup of $(G, *)$ if $(H, *)$ is [group](#group_page_group_definition). 

## Group Generators

The generators of a group $(G, *)$ are a subset of the elements of $G$ from which the whole set can be found via binary operations of the generators. 

Formally, for a group $(G, *)$, a subset $S \subseteq G$ is a generating set if every element in $G$ can be written as a finite product of elements in $S$ and their inverses. Mathematically, this can captured as
\begin{equation}
G = \langle S \rangle = \big\{ s_1^{\alpha_1}s_2^{\alpha_2}\ldots s_k^{\alpha_k} : k \geq 0, s_k \in S~\forall k, ~\alpha_k \in \mathbb{Z}~\forall ~k \big\}.
\end{equation}

## Group Examples

::::{tab-set}
:::{tab-item} Integers/addition 
:sync: tab1

Let $\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of all integers. Let $+$ be the binary operation of addition. Then $(\mathbb{Z}, +)$ is a group. 

:::
:::{tab-item} Invertible real matrices/multiplication
:sync: tab2

Let $\mathbb{M}_n$ be the set of $n \times n$ invertible matrices. Let $\times$ be the binary operator of [matrix multiplication](#traget_matrix_multiplication). Then $(\mathbb{M}_n, \times)$ is a group.  

:::
:::{tab-item} n-qubit Pauli Group
:sync: tab3

The elements of the $n$-qubit Pauli group $\mathcal{P}_n$ are the $n$-fold tensor product of single qubit Pauli-strings with all possible phases:
\begin{equation}
\mathcal{P}_n = \big\{ \mathbb{I}, X, Y, Z \big\}^{\otimes n} \times \{\pm 1, \pm i\}.
\end{equation}
The binary operator is then multiplication. 

See the [Pauli-group page](#Pauli_group_page_target) for more details.
