## TESTING STATES


In quantum mechanics (Dirac notation) elements of the dual space are described using `bras'
\begin{equation}
    \bra{\psi}. 
\end{equation}
If kets can be thought of as column vectors then bras can be thought of as row vectors. In reality they are linear maps that take kets to elements in $\mathbb{C}$. There is no special preference of kets over bras and both hold the same information.Therefore, all of quantum mechanics could be formulated in terms of bras rather than kets.

The dual space is used throughout the formulation of quantum mechanics through linear algebra, notably in the inner product.
